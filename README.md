a robotic arm with multiple joints mounted on a flat, grid-marked base. The arm consists of three articulated segments, connected by circular joints, ending in a claw-like gripper. The structure is drawn in a clean, black-and-white line art style, with simple geometric forms emphasizing mechanical design.
